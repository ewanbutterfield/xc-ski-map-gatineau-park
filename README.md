This is a project I created in 2020 for the IB HL Computer Science IA project. 

Using family and friends as stakeholders I created a interactive map for finding a path through the Gatineau park for cross country skiing. My implementaiton integrated live conditions information scraped from the park authority's website into an interactive map. The application contains 3 modes, the first displaying parkwide information including snow conditions and temperature. The second allowing users to select their own path and see the relevant information for that path, and the final mode generating a path for them based on user inputted criteria, then allowing them to further edit it. I managed to dig up the source files for it and have uploaded it here so that it is documented.
